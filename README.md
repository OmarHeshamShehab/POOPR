# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed to teach and demonstrate key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each folder contains code examples focusing on a specific OOP topic, such as inheritance, method overriding, and abstract classes.

## Introduction

This project is aimed at helping developers understand and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through simple, focused Python examples. The repository is structured in a way that each OOP concept is placed in a separate directory with relevant Python files.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Class Basics

This section introduces the basics of classes and objects in Python. It contains simple examples to get started with understanding how to define classes, create instances, and work with object attributes.

Files:
- `Car.py`
- `Instance.py`

### 2. Class Variables

Demonstrates the use of class variables and how they differ from instance variables in Python.

Files:
- `Cars.py`
- `Instance.py`

### 3. Inheritance

Learn how inheritance works in Python through examples using animals as the core objects.

File:
- `Animals.py`

### 4. Multilevel Inheritance

Explains how one class can inherit from another, and how multilevel inheritance is achieved.

File:
- `Multilevel_Inheritance.py`

### 5. Multiple Inheritance

Shows how a class can inherit from multiple classes in Python.

File:
- `Multiple_Inheritance.py`

### 6. Method Overriding

Covers method overriding, where a child class can provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

File:
- `Method_Overriding.py`

### 7. Method Chaining

Learn how to implement method chaining, a technique that allows multiple methods to be called in a single statement.

File:
- `Method_Chaining.py`

### 8. Super Function

Explains the `super()` function, which is used to give access to methods of a parent class in the context of inheritance.

File:
- `Super_Function.py`

### 9. Abstract Classes

Demonstrates how to define and use abstract classes in Python using the `abc` module.

File:
- `Abstract_Classes.py`

### 10. Objects as Arguments

Covers how objects can be passed as arguments to functions, allowing for more complex behavior and interactions between classes.

File:
- `Objects_as_Arguments.py`

### 11. Decorators

This section covers the use of decorators in Python. Decorators allow extending the behavior of functions without modifying them directly.

In this example, two decorators, `add_sprinkles` and `add_fudge`, are applied to the `get_ice_cream` function, which enhances the behavior of serving ice cream by adding sprinkles and fudge.

File:
- `Decorators.py`

### 12. Static Methods

This section demonstrates the use of static methods in Python. Static methods do not require access to the instance or class and are used for utility functions.

File:
- `Static_Method.py`

### 13. Class Methods

Explains the use of class methods in Python. Class methods can access and modify the class state that applies across all instances.

File:
- `Class_Methods.py`
